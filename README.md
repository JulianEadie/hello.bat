greetings.bat is a DOS(Disk Operation System) or Windows file
that when ran it will open the terminal and will print 
using the code "echo" the starting statement "Hey, how are you"
and if you choose the answer it right then it will close the terminal
and let you be but if you enter the wrong answer then it will close the terminal
and turn off then sign you out of your computer in about a 20 second time frame
because of the given code "shutdown -s -t 20".
This code was just written as an example that you are able to use text file
to run a certain file to do something so simple
